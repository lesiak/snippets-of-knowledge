# Kotlin
# Lambdas vs Anonymous functions
- Lambdas have single return point, anonymous functions can have multiple
- Lambdas do not use explicit return types, but you can put one on anonymous local function
- Lambdas do not do a local return unless you put a label, but an anonomous function does (both return "to the closest fun")
