# Search

### git log -S
- Searches the commit history for changes that added or removed a specific string.
- It is used to find commits where the string was introduced or removed.
- Focuses on historical changes rather than the current state of the repository.
- Example: `git log -S"myString"`

* In a git repo, I know that myString occured in some version of application.conf file. How can I look for versions that added or removed this string?

You can use the git log command with the -S option to find commits that added or removed a specific string in a file. Here's how you can do it:
```
git log -S"myString" -- application.conf
```
**Explanation:**
```
-S"myString": Searches for commits where the string myString was added or removed.
-- application.conf: Limits the search to the application.conf file.
```
This will show a list of commits where the string myString was introduced or removed. You can inspect each commit using git show <commit-hash> to see the exact changes.

### git grep
- Searches for a string or pattern in the content of files in the current working directory or a specific branch.
- It is used to find occurrences of a string in the current state of the repository (or a specific branch).
- Does not provide historical information about when the string was added or removed.
- Example: `git grep "myString"`

> There are potentially three versions of every remote branch:

> 2. Your snapshot of that branch locally (stored under `refs/remotes/...`)

> Let's start with `git prune`. This removes *objects* that are no longer being referenced, it does not remove references. In your case, you have a local branch. That means there's a ref named `random_branch_I_want_deleted` that refers to some objects that represent the history of that branch. So, by definition, `git prune` will not remove `random_branch_I_want_deleted`. Really, `git prune` is a way to delete data that has accumulated in Git but is not being referenced by anything. In general, it doesn't affect your view of any branches.
> 
> `git remote prune origin` and `git fetch --prune` both operate on references under `refs/remotes/...` (I'll refer to these as remote references). It doesn't affect local branches. The git remote version is useful if you only want to remove remote references under a particular remote. Otherwise, the two do exactly the same thing. So, in short, `git remote prune` and `git fetch --prune` operate on number 2 above. For example, if you deleted a branch using the git web GUI and don't want it to show up in your local branch list anymore (`git branch -r`), then this is the command you should use.
> 
> To remove a local branch, you should use git `branch -d` (or `-D` if it's not merged anywhere). FWIW, there is no git command to automatically remove the local tracking branches if a remote branch disappears.

1) Create authors-transform.txt
```sh
svn log -q | awk -F '|' '/^r/ {sub("^ ", "", $2); sub(" $", "", $2); print $2" = "$2" <"$2">"}' | sort -u > authors-transform.txt
```

2) Git Svn Clone Svn repo
```sh
git svn clone --no-metadata -A authors-transform.txt --stdlayout http://SVN_REPO_NO_BRANCH_SUFFIX tmp
# git svn init  --no-metadata --authors-file=authors-transform.txt --stdlayout --prefix=svn/ http://SVN_REPO_NO_BRANCH_SUFFIX
```

3) Change svn tag branches to git tags and remove svn tag branches
```sh
git for-each-ref --format="%(refname:short) %(objectname)" refs/remotes/origin/tags \
| while read BRANCH REF
  do
        TAG_NAME=`echo ${BRANCH#*/} | sed 's/tags\///'`
        BODY="$(git log -1 --format=format:%B $REF)"
        #TAG_NAME1=`echo $TAG_NAME | sed 's/tags\///'`
        
        echo "ref=$REF parent=$(git rev-parse $REF^) tagname=$TAG_NAME body=$BODY" >&2

        git tag -a -m "$BODY" $TAG_NAME $REF^  &&\
        git branch -r -d $BRANCH
done
```
4) Change other svn branches to git branches
```sh
for branch in `git branch -r` ; do  
  BRA=`echo $branch | sed 's/origin\///'`  
  git branch $BRA refs/remotes/$branch
done
```
Remove svn branches
```sh
for branch in `git branch -r` ; do    
  git branch -r -d $branch
done
```

5) [Ignore] Already done Change origin/branch to branch
```sh
git branch -r | sed -e 's/origin\///g' | xargs -I0 git branch -m origin/0 0
git branch -m trunk master
```

6) Pusg to a remote repo
```sh
cd tmp
git remote add origin GIT_REPO
git push --set-upstream origin master 
git push --tags
```
