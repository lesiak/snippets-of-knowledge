  > The predominant use case for permissions boundaries is to limit privileges available to IAM roles created by developers (referred to as delegated administrators in the IAM documentation) who have permissions to create and manage these roles.
  >
  > To limit access, the central administrator can attach a condition to the developer’s identity policy that helps ensure that the developer can only create a role if the role has a permissions boundary policy attached to it.

You do not need to use an internet gateway, NAT device, public IP address, AWS Direct Connect connection, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to allow communication with the service from your private subnets. Therefore, you control the specific API endpoints, sites, and services that are reachable from your VPC.

- Do I need a Direct connect gateway to use AWS Direct Connect?  
  > **When you don't need a Direct Connect Gateway:**
  > **Single connection**: If you have a single AWS Direct Connect connection to a single AWS Region, you don't need a Direct Connect Gateway.
  > **When you need a Direct Connect Gateway:**
  > - Multiple AWS Regions
  > - Multiple AWS Accounts
  An AWS Direct Connect Gateway is a virtual router that allows you to manage and route traffic between your on-premises network and multiple AWS Regions or accounts. It's a logical component that sits between your on-premises network and AWS, providing a centralized point of management for your Direct Connect connections.

- [How do I restrict direct traffic to an Application Load Balancer and allow traffic through only CloudFront?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/waf-restrict-alb-allow-cloudfront)
  > To restrict direct traffic to an Application Load Balancer and allow access only through CloudFront, use one or both of the following solutions:
  > - AWS WAF
  > - Security groups
  >
  > Note: It's a best practice to combine the two following solutions.
  > 
  > To use AWS WAF to restrict direct traffic to an Application Load Balancer and allow traffic through only CloudFront, do the following:
  > 1. Configure CloudFront to add a custom HTTP header with a secret value in the requests that CloudFront sends to the Application Load Balancer.
  > 2. Create a rule in the AWS WAF web access control list (web ACL) associated with the Application Load Balancer. Use this rule to block requests that don't contain the custom HTTP header secret value.
  >
  > You can use security groups to restrict direct traffic to an Application Load Balancer and allow traffic through only CloudFront. To do this, use an AWS managed prefix list on security groups in the Application Load Balancer.
  >
  > To update an existing security group, follow the steps in Update the associated security groups. To associate your Application Load Balancer with a security group, complete the following:
  > 1. Open the Amazon EC2 console.
  > 2. Select Load balancers, and then select the Application Load Balancer that you want to restrict direct access to.
  > 3. Choose Security.
  > 4. Select the security group that you want to associate with your Application Load Balancer.
  > 5. To modify the inbound rules, select Edit inbound rules, and then update the configurations to your use case.
  > 6. To allow specific protocols, select the protocol and then choose Custom.
  > 7. For Source type, choose CloudFront, and then select your prefixes from the AWS managed prefix list.
  > 8. Choose Save.
  >

The Lambda function can be written in any language that Lambda supports. Because it's a proxy integration, you can change the Lambda function implementation at any time without needing to redeploy your API.

  > You can use Route 53 to check the health of your resources and only return healthy resources in response to DNS queries. There are three types of DNS failover configurations:
  > 1. Active-passive: Route 53 actively returns a primary resource. If there's a failure, then Route 53 returns the backup resource. Route 53 configures this method from a failover policy.
  > 2. Active-active: Route 53 actively returns more than one resource. If there's a failure, then Route 53 fails back to the healthy resource. Route 53 configures this method from any routing policy other than a failover.
  > 3. Combination: Multiple routing policies (such as latency-based and weighted) combine into a tree to configure a more complex DNS failover.

- [How is Aurora serverless different than aurora with autoscaling?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74352620/how-is-aurora-serverless-different-than-aurora-with-autoscaling)
  > **AWS Aurora Autoscaling** works by adding more number of reader instances to the Aurora Cluster and when it has to scale down, it remove the reader instances. Important here, this process takes some time to spin up the new reader instances as well to remove them, so you should configure your autoscaling policy accordingly. Autoscaling only add read capacity to Aurora Cluster.
  >
  > **AWS Aurora Serverless** continuously tracks utilization of resources such as CPU, memory, and network and scale any writer or reader instance. AWS Aurora Serverless scales instantly to hundreds of thousands of transactions in a fraction of a second, it adjusts capacity in fine-grained increments to provide the right amount of database resources that the application needs. Aurora Serverles increase write and read capacity to Aurora Cluster.

## SNS
- [What is Amazon SNS?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html)
  > While SNS provides some control over message delivery, such as:
  > 1. **Message filtering**: You can use message attributes and filtering policies to control which messages are delivered to specific subscribers.
  > 2. **Message throttling**: You can set a limit on the number of messages delivered per second to a subscriber.
  >
  > However, SNS does not provide direct control over the flow of messages or buffering, which means that if the consumer is not able to process messages quickly enough, they might be lost or delivered multiple times.

## AWS Organizations
- [Service control policies (SCPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html)
  - SCPs affect only member accounts in the organization. They have no effect on users or roles in the management account.
  - Users and roles must still be granted permissions with appropriate IAM permission policies. A user without any IAM permission policies has no access, even if the applicable SCPs allow all services and all actions.
  - If a user or role has an IAM permission policy that grants access to an action that is also allowed by the applicable SCPs, the user or role can perform that action.
  - If a user or role has an IAM permission policy that grants access to an action that is either not allowed or explicitly denied by the applicable SCPs, the user or role can't perform that action.
  - SCPs affect all users and roles in attached accounts, including the root user. The only exceptions are those described in Tasks and entities not restricted by SCPs.
